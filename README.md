## My process

I started by designing the mobile design first and added any remaing divs / styles needed to complete the project

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile first work-flow
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I experimented by trying not to set any widths for certain elements. My goal was to try to achieve a flexible design that would work on both mobile and desktop.

### Continued development

I still need to learn more about sizing in CSS. I feel whenever I try to do something it never works how I want it to. I feel it's because I don't fully understand what I am doing sometimes so I have to resort to adjusting things by adding margin or padding when there are already capable tools to achieve what I want.
